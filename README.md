# jc-handy-helpers (handy)

## Description
A collection of useful Python classes and functions.

## Deprecated Classes
CaselessString and CaselessString are deprecated.

The CaselessString and CaselessDict classes have been renamed to CIString and CIDict, respectively. There are aliases that map the old names to the new names so legacy code will still run while it's being transitioned to the new class names.

## Installation
Run `python3 -m pip install jc-handy-helpers` to install it. This will install the package named "handy" in your site-packages.
